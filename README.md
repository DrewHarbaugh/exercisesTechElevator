# exercisesTechElevator
These are the exercises that I completed during the first 12 weeks of my Java development bootcamp at Tech Elevator. 
While I wrote most of this code, some of it was provided and I only edited or changed it. 
In other cases we were provided with certain files of a website or cli application and only created the parts that we were currently working on.
I have posted these files for my educational purposes only.
I would also like to point out that the organization and naming of these files is terrible but I had no part in this, I just pushed my entire workspace folder that Tech Elevator set up.
If you are a current Tech Elevator student I suggest you try and solve these problems first yourself before looking at my solutions but if you do get stuck feel free to copy and use whatever you need.
